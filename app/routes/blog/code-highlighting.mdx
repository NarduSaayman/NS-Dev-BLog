import { Link } from "remix";

# {attributes.title}

{attributes.date.toDateString()}

When we talk about code highlighting, it's about having that nice display of readable code from a programming language.

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
function(){
  return "hello world!"
}
```
</div>
---

## But how do we style these in MDX‚ùì

You can think of it like we're converting the markdown into html, with mdx, we can hook into this transformation with some plugins.

- [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) - transforms markdown
- [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) - is an HTML processor


## What are some styling options‚ùì

1. [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/)

2. [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/)

For this project, I chose to pick up some of the highlightJS styles.

## In our case, I reach üëâ for **rehype**
Let's install it...
```
npm install rehype-highlight
```
rehype-highlight is a rehype plugin, using highlightJS.

### Some slight configuration we need to do first

Add an mdx key in our remix config, to allow us to hook into the plugin system.

`remix.config.js`

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```js
module.exports = {
  // some other key: value pairs
  mdx: async (filename) => {
    const [rehypeHighlight] = await Promise.all([
      import("rehype-highlight").then((mod) => mod.default),
    ]);
    return {
      rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],
    };
  },
};
```
</div>

## Now we can build a layout route...

First things first, create a `blog.tsx` file in your routes directory (in the same level as your blog folder). Here we can define any css that will be used on this route.

### Importing a highlightJS style..

We'll also need `Outlet` from remix to display our blog posts.

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
import styles from "highlight.js/styles/github-dark-dimmed.css";
import { LinksFunction, Outlet } from "remix";
```
</div>

Then we just need to link or stylesheets with the `LinksFunction`.

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "stylesheet",
      href: styles,
    },
  ];
};
```
</div>

### Since `blog.tsx` is our layout route for all the blogs...

We need to export a default function and drop in an `<Outlet />`

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
export default function Blog() {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <div className="prose">
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</div>

Awesome, navigate to one of your posts and you should be seeing some code highlighting now.

"But wait, the page still isn't fully styled and just looks like plain html?"

This is where you can write your own custom css, or reach for your favourite styling libraries, I went for tailwindcss, which has a great plugin for styling markdown with a simple classname.

### I won't dive in the setup of tailwind and it's plugin in this post, but here are some helpfull resources:

Remix and tailwindcss have great documentation on setting up tailwind w/ remix.

- [Install Tailwind CSS with Remix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/styling#tailwind-css)

#### ...and then for the tailwind plugin, you should pick up the **Typography Plugin**

- [Tailwind Typography Plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)

it's as simple as adding a `prose` class around your `<Outlet />`

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
<div className="prose">
  <Outlet />
</div>
```
</div>

### Now we can have a look at some of the animations we've seen throughout the blog.
