### Well kind of, let's dive 🏊‍♂️ in properly

<br />

## How do I get started with MDX in Remix 💿?

### What do I install?

Here's the great part. Nothing! Remix 💿 has MDX built in 🏗 and ready to use.
Let's use this page as our example.

#### The same way Remix handles .jsx/.tsx files for routing, the same is handled with .mdx files.

Routing to the file is as simple as navigating to the file in the folder structure

![Routing to mdx]()

### Let's get started with a .mdx file

```

The lines in the document above between the --- are called "frontmatter". You can think of them like metadata for your document, formatted as YAML.

`meta` acts as the same the meta function in a typical route module in remix, we can add the title and description.

We can reference these frontmatter fields in our MDX using the global `attributes` field.


```md

# {attributes.title}

{attributes.date.toDateString()}

## This is it, it's what you're reading right now!

```

Any markdown that you can normally write is valid for mdx:

- lists
  1. Links: [animations](/blog/animations)
  2. > qoute blocks
  3. <mark>Code blocks</mark> and footnotes [^1]
  ```js
   function(){
     return "hello world"
   }
  ```

[^1]: code-highlighting

## [Markdown for the component era](https://mdxjs.com/)

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You write markdown and have the power of embedding components through JSX.

```md
import MyComponent from "./mycomponent.jsx";
export const name = "name of my component";

# {name}

This is some markdown explaining what {name} does.

<MyComponent name={name} someOtherProp="" />
```

Here is an example of importing and adding a `BlogComponent` into the .mdx file...

```jsx

import BlogComponent from "~/components/blog-component";

<BlogComponent 
heading="This is a Blog Component example" 
description="Components can be utilized as we normally do, and it will display in .mdx file." 
/>

```

...and here is what was rendered.
<BlogComponent heading="This is a Blog Component example" description="Components can be utilized as we normally do, and it will display in .mdx file." />

Here is what the inside of that component looks like... 👀

```jsx
type BlogComponentProps = {
  heading: string;
  description: string;
};

export default function BlogComponent(params: BlogComponentProps) {
  const { heading, description } = params;
  return (
    <div className="bg-slate-600 text-white rounded-lg p-8 hover:bg-slate-400 hover:text-black">
      <h3 className="text-white hover:text-black">{heading}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Now for the last bit of setup to get your page looking neat
