### Well kind of, let's dive 🏊‍♂️ in properly

---

## How do I get started with MDX in Remix 💿?

### What do I install ⬇️?

Here's the great part. Nothing! Remix 💿 has MDX built in 🏗 and ready to use.
Let's use this page as our example.

### Let's get started ✨ with a .mdx file named:
`what-is-mdx.mdx`
<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```md

The lines in the document above between the --- are called "frontmatter". You can think of them like metadata for your document, formatted as YAML.

`meta` acts as the same the meta function in a typical route module in remix, we can add the title and description.

We can reference these frontmatter fields in our MDX using the global `attributes` field.


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```md

# {attributes.title}

{attributes.date.toDateString()}

## This is it, it's what you're reading right now!

```
</div>

Any markdown that you can normally write is valid for mdx:

- lists
  1. Links: [animations](/blog/animations)
  2. > qoute blocks
  3. <mark>Code blocks</mark> and footnotes [^1]
  ```js
   function(){
     return "hello world"
   }
  ```
  4. etc. *etc.* __etc.__ __*etc.*__

[^1]: code-highlighting

### Routing to the file. 🚏

#### The same way Remix handles .jsx/.tsx files for routing, the same is handled with .mdx files.

Routing to the file is as simple as navigating to the file in the folder structure

## Unpacking MDX 📦 a bit more...

### [Markdown for the component era](https://mdxjs.com/)

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You write markdown and have the power of embedding components through JSX.


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```md
import MyComponent from "./mycomponent.jsx";
export const name = "name of my component";

# {name}

This is some markdown explaining what {name} does.

<MyComponent name={name} someOtherProp="" />
```
</div>

#### Comparing .mdx and .jsx

These 2 files' output will look the same

<div className="flex gap-5">
  <div className="w-6/12">
    `expressions.mdx`
    ```jsx
    export const authors = [
  {name: 'Jane', email: 'hi@jane.com'},
  {name: 'John', twitter: '@john2002'}
]
export const published = new Date('2022-02-01')

Written by: {new Intl.ListFormat('en').format(authors.map(d => d.name))}.

Published on: {new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {dateStyle: 'long'}).format(published)}.
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="w-6/12">
`equivalent.jsx`
    ```jsx
    <>
  <p>Written by: Jane and John.</p>
  <p>Published on: February 1, 2022.</p>
</>
```
  </div>
</div>

#### ...so if .mdx is .jsx under the hood can't I also just write any other viable .jsx❓

### Yes it can❗️

Here is an example of importing and adding a `BlogComponent` into the .mdx file...

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
import BlogComponent from "~/components/blog-component";

<BlogComponent 
heading="This is a Blog Component example" 
description="Components can be utilized as we normally do, and it will display in .mdx file." 
/>
```
</div>

...and here is what was rendered.
<BlogComponent heading="This is a Blog Component example" description="Components can be utilized as we normally do, and it will display in the .mdx file." />

Here is what the inside of that component looks like... 👀


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
type BlogComponentProps = {
  heading: string;
  description: string;
};

export default function BlogComponent(props: BlogComponentProps) {
  const { heading, description } = props;
  return (
    <div
      className="group transition ease-in-out text-white rounded-lg p-8 hover:scale-105 
    bg-gradient-to-bl from-green-300 via-blue-500 to-purple-600 
    hover:bg-gradient-to-br hover:from-pink-500 hover:via-red-500 hover:to-yellow-500"
    >
      <h3 className="text-white group-hover:animate-bounce">
        <span className="hidden group-hover:inline">🪅 </span>
        {heading}
        <span className="hidden group-hover:inline"> 🪅</span>
      </h3>
      <p className="group-hover:animate-pulse">{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</div>

### Home stretch 🚵‍♂️

Just need to make a list 📝 of our blogs with an `index.tsx`, we are probably going to write more than 1 post right?

#### Not only can you reference other components within the MDX, we can refference the MDX anywhere.

We'll import the `what-is-mdx.mdx` file, and the `LoaderFunction` from Remix 💿.

<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
import { Link, LoaderFunction, useLoaderData } from "remix";
import * as whatIsMdx from "./what-is-mdx.mdx";
```
</div>

Then, we write a simple function to get the slug with it's attributes...


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
function postFromModule(mod: any) {
  return {
    slug: mod.filename.replace(/\.mdx?$/, ""),
    ...mod.attributes.meta,
  };
}
```
</div>

Use a loader function to load the array of blogs...


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
export const loader: LoaderFunction = () => {
  return [postFromModule(whatIsMdx)];
};
```
</div>

Finally, render our list...


<div className="transition ease-out hover:scale-105">
```jsx
export default function BlogIndex() {
  const posts = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post: any) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link to={post.slug}>{post.title}</Link>
            {post.description ? (
              <p className="m-0 lg:m-0">{post.description}</p>
            ) : null}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</div>

### "But wait my codeblocks and styling doesn't look anything like what you have. Did I miss something?"

In this next post I write about how to implement code highlighting and quick styling.

---

<div className="flex">
  <Link to={`../code-highlighting`} className="transition ease-in-out
    ml-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg text-white
    hover:scale-105 no-underline hover:underline 
    bg-gradient-to-bl from-green-300 via-blue-500 to-purple-600 
    hover:bg-gradient-to-br hover:from-pink-500 hover:via-red-500 hover:to-yellow-500" >
    <div>
      <h4 style={{ marginTop: "0px" }} className="pt-4 pb-2 px-5 text-white">Code Highlighting 👉</h4>
    </div>
  </Link>
</div>
