import { Link } from "remix";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export const toLeft = -1
export const toRight = 1

<motion.div
  initial={{
    x: -100 * toLeft,
    opacity: 0,
  }}
  whileInView={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },
    opacity: { delay: 0.2 },
  }}

# {attributes.title}
</motion.div>

<motion.div
  initial={{
    y: 50,
    opacity: 0,
  }}
  whileInView={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}

Animation is a great way improve user experience. Without them, transitions can seem abrupt and jarring üõ∏. Sometimes content on a site just feels outright boring. I like it when a website takes me on journey.
</motion.div>

## What did I use‚ùì

### üëâ [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

> A production-ready motion library for React. Utilize the power behind Framer, the best prototyping tool for teams. Proudly open source.

#### Installation

```
npm install framer-motion
```

#### Imports

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion"
```

You're all set and ready to animate‚ùóÔ∏è

#### All you need to do now is wrap your content in a `<motion>` component

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ scale: 0.5 }}>
  <div>
    <p>Some content</p>
  </div>
</motion.div>
```

`motion` is the core of the Motion API, and there's a motion component for every HTML and SVG elements.

- `<motion.div>`
- `<motion.ul>`
- `<motion.li>`
- `<motion.h1>`
- etc...

### Let's try and make some more interesting and custom animations

#### A `motion` can have multiple props defining some things, let's have a look...

A motion to have an element fade in...

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
/>
```

A motion to move an element to it's correct position...
```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ x: -100, y: 100 }}
  animate={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
/>
```

Not only can you move and change the opacity, you can add some transition effects to how your element should move to it's position...

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -100, y: 100 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 x: 0, y: 0 }}
  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },
    opacity: { delay: 0.2 },
  }}
/>
```

Motion is now your oyster, be creative and start playing with animations.

### Here are some snippets of animation from this blog.

```jsx
export const toLeft = -1
export const toRight = 1

<motion.div
  initial={{
    x: -100 * toLeft,
    opacity: 0,
  }}
  whileInView={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },
    opacity: { delay: 0.2 },
  }}
>
// Code Block
</motion.div>
```

  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },

  }}
