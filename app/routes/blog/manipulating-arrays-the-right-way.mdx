  description: I was trying to manipulate and build an array that would be used to make a PUT request to an API. I did a terrible job at it, so I learned how to do it better. ✨

import TableLogic from "~/components/table-logic";
import { Link } from "remix";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export const toLeft = -1
export const toRight = 1

<motion.div
  initial={{
    x: -100 * toLeft,
    opacity: 0,
  }}
  whileInView={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", duration: 0.8, delay: 0.2 },
    opacity: { delay: 0.2 },
  }}

## The Context❓

I had an interesting problem to solve. 🤔 A user would query some name with a starting and ending date 📅 and get back a list of results with some generic data and a status associated to each item. Here is where the problem comes in.
First thing is to render the list results in a table. I didn't have the luxury of a library to handle my table, so the good ol' `<table>` had to do. 👌

### The Table Logic 🧮
The table would display the array 🀠 of results where each result will have some genereic data, like a name, numbers and a status. The table will need two inputs to agree or disagree. These inputs are checkboxes ☑, where the status changes depending on the state of the two checkboxes.

* Waiting ⌛ - Nothing selected
* Agreed ✔ - Agree selected
* Disagreed ❌ - Disagree selected

Both Agreed ✔ and Disagreed ❌, can't be selected at the same time.

### The Solution 💡

One of the solutions would be to just modify the original result that came from the search, and send back the modification... Though in this case editing the orginal was a no-no. 🚫

This leads to having to create a new array with the changes...

Here is where I was starting to build and do silly manipulations that weren't ideal. An example would be to push changes to an array, and then change any entry with the unique number 1 and number 2 combination that match the result from the checkbox change events.

I would then find an odd use case for `new Set( )`, where I would take that array with all the duplicates and set itself to an array of a new set of itself... yes, I know, I don't know what I was thinking there...

I had my "This is a bad idea" voice in my head...

```jsx
arrayToUpdate = [...new Set(arrayToUpdate)]
```

### Redemption 🎇

After re-thinking my approach I started fresh and looked at first finding the correct result that needs to be changed. I'd have a funciton I would call each time the status changed, giving it the result and the status it should change to.

```jsx
changeStatus(resultData: Data, status: string){
  if(resultData){
    (resultData.status === 'Waiting ⌛' || resultData.status !== status) ? 
    resultData.status = status : 
    resultData.status = resultData.status = 'Waiting ⌛'

    addResultToUpdate(resultData, status)
  }
}
```

```jsx
addResultToUpdate(resultData: Data, status: string){

  const resultToUpdate = originalData.find(
    originalResult =>
      (resultData.number1 === originalResult.number1) &&
      (resultData.number2 === originalResult.number2))
...
}
```

Great, I now have the record, I'll need to just add it to the new array to update their statuses. Easy enough, just push onto the array... but I'm doing a lot of changes and using `array.push()` can lead to some unwanted changes to the data in the array. A better approach is to then spread the original and then appending the new content.

```jsx
...
    resultsToUpdate = [
      ...resultsToUpdate,
      {
      number1: resultData.number1,
      number2: resultData.number2,
      newStatus: status,
      }
    ]
...
```

Nice, now I'm starting to work and manipualte the array a bit better, but one thing that's still a problem though is what if there is a duplicate?

Rather than pushing duplicates onto the array, check if there is a unique entry in the array and then update that entry. I'll just check if that `find()` I did earlier found a value, if it does great, I have something to index on. If it doesn't have anything I can just add the new value. 

So here is the solution:
```jsx
addResultToUpdate(resultData: Data, status: string){

  const resultToUpdate = originalData.find(
    originalResult =>
      (resultData.number1 === originalResult.number1) &&
      (resultData.number2 === originalResult.number2))

  if(resultToUpdate)
    resultsToUpdate[resultsToUpdate.indexOf(resultToUpdate)] = 
    {
      ...resultToUpdate, 
      newStatus: status
    }
  else
  resultsToUpdate = [
    ...resultsToUpdate,
    {
    number1: resultData.number1,
    number2: resultData.number2,
    newStatus: status,
    }
  ]
}
```

#### It worked a little something like this:

<TableLogic />

</motion.div>
